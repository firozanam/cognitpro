fix: resolve analytics dashboard JavaScript error and enhance defensive programming

- Fix critical "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')" error in analytics dashboard
- Implement comprehensive defensive programming with null/undefined checks for all array operations
- Add React Error Boundary with custom fallback UI for graceful error handling
- Enhance backend error handling with try-catch blocks and safe data structure fallbacks
- Update TypeScript interfaces to properly reflect nullable data structures
- Replace direct .toFixed() calls with safe utility functions (safeToFixed)
- Add loading skeleton component for better user experience during data fetching
- Create comprehensive test suite covering null/undefined data scenarios and service exceptions
- Ensure consistent data serialization from Laravel collections to frontend arrays
- Implement proper logging for analytics errors with detailed context information

Technical improvements:
- Defensive programming patterns with comprehensive null/undefined checks
- Safe array initialization and operations to prevent runtime errors
- Enhanced TypeScript type safety with nullable interface properties
- React Error Boundary implementation for graceful error recovery
- Backend exception handling with safe fallback data structures
- Consistent use of safe utility functions for number formatting and calculations
- Loading states and skeleton components for improved user experience
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and exception scenarios
